# YOLO-Object-Detection


Object detection detect all instances of objects from a known class, such as people, cars or faces in an image. YOLO is a real time object detection algorithm. 
It is a single-stage detector that tackles problems of object identification and classification, that too in a single pass of the network. Although it is not the only single-stage detector, it is better in terms of speed and accuracy.
